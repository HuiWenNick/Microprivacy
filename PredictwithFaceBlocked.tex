There is another situation for predicting the location of the visual eavesdropper. The visual eavesdropper is moving into the blocked area that the camera can not detect human. This area that inside the monitoring view is blocked by phone user's face. At this situation, the probability of the invisible
human eavesdropping is expressed as :

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& P(t|M)=P(\tau|M)=1-\frac{sp*t}{d^*\cos\gamma*(f_w*\frac{d^*}{d'})+\epsilon}
\end{split}
\label{eqn:prob}
\end{equation}
